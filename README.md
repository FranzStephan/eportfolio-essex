# MSc Cybersecurity – e-Portfolio  
Security and Risk Management Module  
University of Essex Online

This e-portfolio presents my work and reflections for the Security and Risk Management module. It includes weekly summaries, discussion points, group project contributions, and a final critical reflection. The entries are structured by unit and aligned with the intended learning outcomes.

---

## Unit 1: Introduction to Security and Risk Management  
Notes:  Today on August 1. I finished the lecturecast, whoch was talking about the basics of risk assessment, difference between quantifying and qualifying risks, OCTAVE and common standards, for example ISO 27001.
-  
Seminar: Introduction into module, assignments explained, how to organise and find groups has been explained and furthermore assignment details.

Reflection:  This Unit gave me a brief but wide overview on Risk Assessment and the future topics of this module as well as assignment work.
-

## Unit 2: Users, Assessments and the Risk Management Process  
Notes:  This unit explored the differences between qualitative and quantitative risk assessments, and emphasised the importance of user participation in the Risk Management Process (RMP). The reading (Spears & Barki, 2010) highlighted how user involvement improves both accuracy and acceptance of risk analysis.
-  

Reflection: This unit helped me consider how different assessment approaches can shape the outcome of a risk review. When working on the risk matrices for the group project, I applied both perspectives and thought about how user input could influence prioritisation. This gave our analysis more balance and showed me the value of involving different viewpoints.

## Unit 3: Threat Modelling and Management  
Notes: We reviewed the difference between threats and vulnerabilities, and compared several threat modelling approaches, including STRIDE, DREAD, attack trees and hybrid models such as PASTA. The reading provided an overview of tools and frameworks commonly applied in practice. 
-  

Reflection:  This unit gave me a structured way to think about threats beyond just listing risks. For the group assignment, it shaped how I approached describing different categories of threats and where to position them in the risk matrix. Personally, it improved my ability to match frameworks to scenarios rather than relying on one standard method.
-

## Unit 4: Applying Threat Modelling Techniques  
Notes:  This unit applied the threat modelling techniques discussed earlier, using resources such as the Threat Modelling Manifesto, OWASP cookbook, and MITRE ATT&CK database. Exercises included building models and evaluating their strengths in different scenarios.
-  

Reflection:  Practising with these frameworks helped me see how to move from theory to application. In the assignment, I could explain why certain threats scored higher in the risk matrix by linking them to structured models. This also made me more confident in selecting tools that fit the scenario instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach.
-

## Unit 5: Industry and Enterprise Security Standards  
Notes:  We examined the role of industry standards in security and risk management, including ISO 27001 and other common frameworks. The lecture and readings showed how standards shape assessments, influence compliance, and guide mitigation strategies.
-  

Reflection:  This unit made me more aware of how standards underpin risk analysis in practice. While working on the group assignment, I kept in mind how industry-specific standards (such as ISO or PCI-DSS) could affect a company’s risk profile. It also gave me a better understanding of why compliance is often a key driver in risk management.
-

## Unit 6: Practical Implications of Standards  
Notes:  The focus was on case studies, especially around GDPR and other compliance regimes such as PCI-DSS. We reviewed how standards apply in real scenarios and how organisations can mitigate risks to meet regulatory requirements.
-  

Reflection:  This unit connected the theory of standards with practical business cases. For the project, it helped me frame the risk assessment in a way that considered not only technical threats but also regulatory exposure. It also made me reflect on the importance of presenting risk findings so that businesses can act on them in line with compliance needs.

## Final Reflective Piece  
To be completed at the end of the module. This section will include a 1,000-word reflective summary on individual learning, team collaboration, module content, and personal development.

## Skills Matrix (to be completed)  
This section will contain a short overview of professional and academic skills developed throughout the module. It may include observations on time management, communication, technical tools, collaboration, critical thinking, and analytical skills. Entries will be completed as part of the final review.
