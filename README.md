## Unit 1: Introduction to Security and Risk Management  
Notes:  Today on August 1. I finished the lecturecast, whoch was talking about the basics of risk assessment, difference between quantifying and qualifying risks, OCTAVE and common standards, for example ISO 27001.
-  
Seminar: Introduction into module, assignments explained, how to organise and find groups has been explained and furthermore assignment details.

Reflection:  This Unit gave me a brief but wide overview on Risk Assessment and the future topics of this module as well as assignment work.
-

## Unit 2: Users, Assessments and the Risk Management Process  
Notes:  This unit explored the differences between qualitative and quantitative risk assessments, and emphasised the importance of user participation in the Risk Management Process (RMP). The reading (Spears & Barki, 2010) highlighted how user involvement improves both accuracy and acceptance of risk analysis.
-  

Reflection: This unit helped me consider how different assessment approaches can shape the outcome of a risk review. When working on the risk matrices for the group project, I applied both perspectives and thought about how user input could influence prioritisation. This gave our analysis more balance and showed me the value of involving different viewpoints.
-

## Unit 3: Threat Modelling and Management  
Notes: We reviewed the difference between threats and vulnerabilities, and compared several threat modelling approaches, including STRIDE, DREAD, attack trees and hybrid models such as PASTA. The reading provided an overview of tools and frameworks commonly applied in practice. 
-  

Reflection:  This unit gave me a structured way to think about threats beyond just listing risks. For the group assignment, it shaped how I approached describing different categories of threats and where to position them in the risk matrix. Personally, it improved my ability to match frameworks to scenarios rather than relying on one standard method.
-  

---

## Unit 4: Applying Threat Modelling Techniques  
Notes:  This unit applied the threat modelling techniques discussed earlier, using resources such as the Threat Modelling Manifesto, OWASP cookbook, and MITRE ATT&CK database. Exercises included building models and evaluating their strengths in different scenarios.
-  

Reflection:  Practising with these frameworks helped me see how to move from theory to application. In the assignment, I could explain why certain threats scored higher in the risk matrix by linking them to structured models. This also made me more confident in selecting tools that fit the scenario instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach.
-  

---

## Unit 5: Industry and Enterprise Security Standards  
Notes:  We examined the role of industry standards in security and risk management, including ISO 27001 and other common frameworks. The lecture and readings showed how standards shape assessments, influence compliance, and guide mitigation strategies.
-  

Reflection:  This unit made me more aware of how standards underpin risk analysis in practice. While working on the group assignment, I kept in mind how industry-specific standards (such as ISO or PCI-DSS) could affect a company’s risk profile. It also gave me a better understanding of why compliance is often a key driver in risk management.
-  

---

## Unit 6: Practical Implications of Standards  
Notes:  The focus was on case studies, especially around GDPR and other compliance regimes such as PCI-DSS. We reviewed how standards apply in real scenarios and how organisations can mitigate risks to meet regulatory requirements.
-  

Reflection:  This unit connected the theory of standards with practical business cases. For the project, it helped me frame the risk assessment in a way that considered not only technical threats but also regulatory exposure. It also made me reflect on the importance of presenting risk findings so that businesses can act on them in line with compliance needs.

Meeting Notes: Team Cipher – Meeting Notes (Week 3)

Date: 14 August 2025  
Platform: WhatsApp (informal chat, summarised here)

Agenda:
- Decide on methodology framework
- Assign tasks for risk assessment sections
- Plan outline structure

Discussion Points:
- Agreed ISO 31000 is most suitable for small business case
- Franz to draft outline and build risk matrices
- Ketan to expand methodology section and add references
- Both to review risk sections before Week 5 seminar

Actions:
- Outline and initial matrices by Franz – 17 August
- Methodology draft by Ketan – 20 August
- Joint review session planned – 25 August

Notes: This unit focused on case studies, especially around GDPR and PCI-DSS, and highlighted how standards apply in real scenarios. We reviewed how organisations can mitigate risks and maintain compliance by aligning their practices with established frameworks. The examples showed the consequences of both compliance failures and effective implementation.

Reflection: This unit helped me connect the theory of standards with practical business cases in a way that directly supported our group project. It shaped how I framed the Pampered Pets risk assessment, encouraging me to consider not only technical risks but also regulatory exposure. I also reflected on the importance of presenting risk findings clearly so that businesses can act on them in line with compliance needs. For my own contribution, I focused on expanding the methodology section and integrating references, which gave me a stronger appreciation of how ISO 31000 can be adapted for small businesses. Looking ahead, this unit reinforced the value of applying compliance standards flexibly so they can serve both regulatory and operational objectives.

## Unit 7: Quantitative Risk Modelling  
Notes:  This unit introduced the core ideas of quantitative risk modelling, including probability distributions, expected loss, and simulation techniques such as Monte Carlo. The focus was on how data can improve the precision of decision-making compared with purely qualitative assessments.
-  

Reflection:  Even without running full simulations myself, I understood how quantifying uncertainty gives clearer visibility of potential outcomes. The material showed that numbers are useful only when assumptions are sound and clearly documented. Quantitative methods can strengthen, not replace, professional judgment.
-  

---

## Unit 8: Applying Quantitative Risk Models  
Notes:  The emphasis was on applying the models from Unit 7 to real situations. Case studies demonstrated sensitivity analysis and how model outputs support management choices.
-  

Reflection:  I learned how quantitative results can be communicated in plain language for decision-makers. The examples showed that clear visualisation and concise explanation often matter more than complex formulas. I gained a more practical sense of how evidence supports prioritisation of controls.
-  

---

## Unit 9: Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery  
Notes:  This unit presented BC/DR concepts such as Business Impact Analysis, Recovery Time Objective (RTO), and Recovery Point Objective (RPO). It connected these to wider risk-management processes and regulatory expectations (e.g. ISO 22301).
-  

Reflection:  I found it interesting how resilience depends on both technology and planning. The case examples illustrated that small decisions—like backup frequency or staff training, can have major effects on recovery capability. I now see BC/DR as a continuous improvement activity rather than a one-off plan.
-  

---

## Unit 10: Practical DR Design  
Notes:  The material compared hot, warm, and cold recovery sites, plus cloud-based and hybrid DR solutions. It also covered the trade-off between cost, complexity, and recovery speed.
-  

Reflection: This clarified how to set realistic targets instead of aiming for perfect recovery. I recognised that outsourcing resilience can create new dependencies, so multi-region or hybrid approaches may be safer. The unit reinforced the idea that documentation and periodic testing are critical.
-  

---

## Unit 11: Future Trends in Security and Risk Management  
Notes: Topics included automation, zero-trust models, AI-driven risk analysis, and evolving regulations. The readings discussed how data analytics and continuous monitoring shape adaptive security.
-  

Reflection: I learned that technology will increasingly support risk management, but human oversight remains essential. Ethical governance, transparency, and accountability must evolve alongside automation. The trend toward continuous assessment fits well with quantitative modelling principles.
-  

---

## Unit 12: The Great Debate  
Notes:  The final unit summarised emerging trends and asked which will most influence risk management over the next five years. Discussions revolved around AI, quantum-safe cryptography, and regulatory harmonisation.
-  

Reflection:  I concluded that AI-supported automation, combined with human control, will likely have the greatest impact. It connects threat detection, response, and governance in one cycle. This view summarises my overall learning: integrate data and technology responsibly, without losing human judgment.
-

## Group Project  
Project title:  Pampered Pets Risk Assessment and Digitalisation Strategy
-  The project focused on evaluating the potential risks and benefits of digitalising a small retail business. Using the ISO 31000 framework, our team assessed threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigations for both the existing in-store model and a digitalised version of Pampered Pets.

My role:  

Drafted the initial outline of the report and developed the first version of the risk matrices for both the current and proposed business models.

Took part in selecting and justifying ISO 31000 as the most suitable framework for a small enterprise context.

Contributed short notes on digitalisation-related risks such as supplier dependency and data protection.

Reviewed the final report before submission to ensure structure and consistency.
-  

Individual contributions: 

Created the basic report layout with clear sections for methodology, assessment, and recommendations.

Compared ISO 31000 with other options such as NIST SP 800-30 and OCTAVE.

Helped define qualitative likelihood and impact scales for the risk matrix.

Participated in refining the summary and recommendations section after team review.
-  

Challenges encountered:

Coordinating work across time zones and combining different writing styles was difficult.

Condensing complex content into short, clear points required discipline and communication.

Limited live meetings made it necessary to rely on written updates and recordings.
-  

Lessons learned: 

Applying theoretical frameworks to a realistic business case strengthened my practical understanding of risk assessment.

I learned how teamwork improves clarity through multiple perspectives.

The experience improved my ability to structure reports, prioritise key risks, and communicate findings effectively.
-

## Final Reflective Piece  
Across this module my understanding of security and risk management developed from theory to practice. The early units established key concepts such as threats, vulnerabilities, and the structure of risk management frameworks. Later units introduced quantitative risk modelling, business continuity, and disaster recovery, which connected technical knowledge to operational resilience.

Working on the Pampered Pets project helped me translate theory into a practical group assignment. Drafting the outline and developing the risk matrices improved my ability to organise material and link academic models to business decisions. Collaborating remotely taught me to communicate clearly and adapt to different work styles.

Even though I could not attend every live seminar, I kept up through recordings and readings. This method allowed me to learn at my own pace and reflect more deeply on how each topic connected to the overall theme of resilience and governance.

The final trend discussions on automation, AI, and ethics encouraged me to think about the future of risk management. I now see that technical precision must be combined with human oversight and clear accountability.

Overall, this module strengthened both my technical awareness and professional skills. I feel confident in analysing risks systematically, presenting them clearly, and applying continuous improvement in real-world contexts.

I became better at expressing complex risk management ideas in plain language that non-technical readers can understand. Writing reflections and contributing to the group report improved my ability to present structured and concise information.

Teamwork
Working remotely with different personalities helped me develop clearer coordination and more patience when combining work from several sources. I learned how to communicate expectations and provide constructive feedback.

Critical Thinking
Comparing frameworks such as ISO 31000, NIST SP 800-30, and OCTAVE strengthened my analytical judgment. I learned to justify methodological choices instead of copying examples blindly.

Technical Understanding
Through the module I gained familiarity with practical aspects of risk assessment, business continuity, and disaster recovery. I now understand how theoretical principles translate into small-business environments.

Time Management
Balancing readings, project coordination, and written reflections required planning. I learned to prioritise tasks and to work efficiently within limited timeframes.

Reflective Practice
Writing regular notes and reflections made me more aware of how I learn best. It also helped me recognise progress and identify areas that need improvement for future modules.
